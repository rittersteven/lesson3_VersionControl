## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Versioning control systems allow easy collaboration between multiple developers by offering access to one constantly updated and stored file that every developer can work on.
2. Distributed version control systems mirror the entire repository to the clients local machine which avoids the risk of dependance on one single server.
3. Git categorizes your files into three different states: committed, modified and staged.
