            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Software development, as well as many other coding projects, is usually executed by multiple people. In order to increase efficiency, team members often have to work on the same file at the same time or need access to older versions of that file for example. Versioning control systems enable just that and more. They basically act as a central storage unit for all project files. Team members can access any file, make changes and update the version control server consequently. All team members will now have access to the new file as well as the older version. The VCS makes note of who changed what file, the date and time of the change and what exactly was changed. This clearly helps and improves the efficiency of software projects multiple people are involved in.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A popular version control method choice are local version control systems. However, if you're copying files into another directory it is often possible to lose track of the directory you're currently in or making unwanted changes to your files. VCS tools offer a workaround for these type of problems. A popular system for this is RCS which is often inluded with many computers even today. Its main draw point is the ability to store your various file versions in a special format on your disk. RCS can then always combine or remove your file versions and that way recreate the file at any point in time.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Centralized Version Control Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">To solve the need for collaboration between multiple developers on software projects, centralized version control systems were created. Systems like CVS, Subversion and Perforce store every versioned file on a single server that can be accessed by every developer. Files can be checked out, edited and then returned back to the main server which stores the updated file as well as any version before it. This offers many administrative advantages like the ability to control who works on what file. However, its biggest drawback is one of its main appeals. Storing your work in a single, central place is a huge liability because in a worst case scenario it can compromise all your work if the server gets corrupted or shuts down, preventing you of being able to work on your files.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Distributed Control Version Systems</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The final solution for the above mentioned problems was the advent of distributed control version systems. Instead of only pulling one file to work on from the server, clients are fully mirroring the entire repository from the main server. This method neutralizes the biggest drawback of centralized version control systems. Should the server ever fail or its contents get corrupted, any client that accessed it can easily store every file version to a new server because all of its contents were duplicated onto the clients local computer. Additionally, distributed version control systems allow several remote repositories that open up collaboration between developers in different ways simultaneously in the same project. Even hierarchical models are possible which improve efficiency immensely.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">The three states of Git</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When working with Git, your files reside in three different states on the server: commited, modified and staged. When commited, your file is safely stored on the server and fully part of the database of files. In the case of modified, the file is currently worked on and has been changed. However, the file won't be uploaded to the database until you commit it. The "staged" state allows to prepare a currently modified file for the next commit snapshot. This is useful when you need to commit only certain parts of a file, while still having to work on the current version. The staged part of the file gets commited to the database, while you are still able to complete the rest of your work on the unstaged part without having to commit the entire code of the file.</p>
